    Given a gibberish string {gibberish}, find the most probable English word hidden inside it.
    Instructions:
    - Give just the word, no explanation, no method, no extra text.
    - Explicit content not allowed.
    - Search through the entire English vocabulary you know â€” no external word list will be provided.
    - A word is considered hidden if its letters appear in the same order (left to right) in the gibberish string.
    - Random extra letters may appear between the correct ones (gaps are allowed), but no skipping back is allowed.
    - Each character from the gibberish can be used only once in order.
    - Calculate the match percentage: (number of matched letters / total letters in the word) * 100.
    - word is considered found if at least 60% of its letters match in order.
    - Prefer longer and more complete words when multiple matches are found.
